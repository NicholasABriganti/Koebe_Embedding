Koebe Embedding
===============


Implementation of the Koebe Embedding (Circle Packing) theorem. This theorem states that:

If G is a finite triangulated planar graph, then the circle packing whose tangency graph is (isomorphic to) G is unique, up to MÃ¶bius transformations and reflections in lines.
